# Fabric Magic Bowl
Get infinite amounts of items with the magic bowl.

## Usage
### Obtaining
Get the item called `magic_bowl:magic_bowl`. This mod does not include a crafting recipe for this bowl, so the only way of getting it is the miscellaneous tab in the creative inventory or using `/give`.

### Adding items to the bowl
Right click with the magic bowl. Then put any item into the first slot. Then close the menu. The item name will now say `${item} in Magic Bowl`.

### Taking items from the bowl
Once loaded with an item, right click on the magic bowl to take the item. It will go into your inventory. There is a 3 second cooldown.

### Removing items from the bowl
If you want to change what item is in the bowl, you need to wash it. Wash it by right clicking it while looking at water.

## Installing
Download the mod from the releases.
